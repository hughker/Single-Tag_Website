# Single-Tag_Website

View it live: http://cj-johnson.github.io/Single-Tag_Website

This is an entire webpage that uses only ONE html tag (the &lt;link> tag) and yet through the magic of CSS looks like any other regular webpage, complete with sections, pictures, text, and the like!

Don't believe me? Right click the page and click "view page source". You will see absolutely no Javascript and only a single HTML tag. The rest is pure, beautfil CSS. :)
